## About The Project

This project provides a template and best practice for developing multi-agent AI workflows, leveraging various agentic frameworks, modern LLMs and AI evaluation strategies. It demonstrates:

- **Multi-agent orchestration strategies** across different frameworks (LangGraph, LlamaIndex, Agno)
- **Metacognitive AI agents** with self-awareness and responsible decision-making capabilities
- **AI Safety & Compliance** in financial domains with built-in ethical boundaries and professional referral systems
- **Integration with local and cloud LLMs**, including SOTA (OpenAI / Google Gemini) and Open Weight models (Llama, Qwen, DeepSeek)
- **RAG pipeline** for document-based retrieval and analysis
- **Evaluation metrics** for agent orchestration, tool execution and RAG quality

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.11.9**
- **uv**: High-performance Python package manager ([uv installation](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv))
- **Google Gemini API Key**: Provided by the FINOS Team and set as `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in your environment
- **Tavily Search API Key**: [Get from Tavily](https://tavily.com/) and set as `TAVILY_SEARCH_API_KEY`
- **Scaleway GenAI API Key**: Provided by the FINOS team and set as `SCW_SECRET_KEY`
- (Optional) **LM Studio** for local LLM serving ([Download LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/))

## Environment Setup

Rename the `.env.new` file in your project root to `.env` and update with the API Keys provided by the FINOS team.

## Installation

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your_username/agent-quickstart.git
cd agent-quickstart
uv sync
```

## Setup

- **Local LLM (Optional)**:
  - Install LM Studio
  - Download a compatible model (e.g., qwen3-8b)
  - Start LM Studio server on `http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1`

## Input Data

- Place PDF documents (10K or 10Q reports) to be processed in `data/input/`
- Converted markdown files will be saved in `data/output/`

## Usage Examples

We have three agent examples, each demonstrating different approaches to multi-agent AI workflows and financial analysis:

### Reflexive Metacognitive Financial Advisor with LangGraph

The `langgraph_agent_example.ipynb` notebook demonstrates an advanced **Reflexive Metacognitive Financial Agent** that maintains explicit awareness of its financial knowledge boundaries, confidence levels, and ethical responsibilities. This agent showcases:

- **Self-Aware Decision Making**: The agent analyzes each query against its capabilities before responding
- **Multi-Strategy Routing**: Chooses between direct reasoning, specialized tool usage, or escalation to professionals
- **Built-in AI Safety**: Explicit ethical boundaries and regulatory compliance in financial advice
- **Professional Referral System**: Rather than refusing help, provides constructive guidance on finding qualified professionals
- **Scaleway AI Integration**: Demonstrates integration with Scaleway's GenAI API infrastructure

The agent asks critical questions like:
- "Do I have sufficient expertise to provide guidance on this financial topic?"
- "Is this query within my designated area of financial knowledge?"
- "Is this a high-stakes financial decision where incorrect advice could cause significant harm?"

This example is particularly valuable for understanding **AI safety and responsibility** in financial domains, where poor advice can have serious real-world consequences.

### SEC 10-K & 10-Q Filings Analysis with LlamaIndex

 The `llama_index_agent_example.ipynb` notebook demonstrates how to:

- Load environment variables
- Convert PDFs to markdown
- Generate vector database
- Query and evaluate RAG pipeline
- Define and run multi-agent workflow
- Leverage DeepEval across the flow execution, with a LLM-as-Judge approach

### Stock Data and Sentiment Analysis with Agno

The `agno_agent_example.ipynb` notebook demonstrates how to:

- Leverage Google Search for web search on recent information to produce sentiment analysis
- Leverage Yahoo Finance for financial data retrieval including historical stock prices and financial ratios
- Define and run multi-agent workflow to produce an analyst report
