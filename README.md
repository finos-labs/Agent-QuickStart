## About The Project

This project provides a template and best practice for developing multi-agent AI workflows, leveraging various agentic frameworks, modern LLMs and AI evaluation strategies. It demonstrates:

- Multi-agent orchestration strategies 
- Integration with local and cloud LLMs, including SOTA (OpenAI / Google Gemini) and Open Weight models (Llama, Qwen, DeepSeek)
- RAG pipeline for document-based retrieval
- Evaluation metrics for agent orchestration, tool execution and RAG quality

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.11.9**
- **uv**: High-performance Python package manager ([uv installation](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv))
- **Google Gemini API Key**: Provided by the FINOS Team and set as `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in your environment
- **Tavily Search API Key**: [Get from Tavily](https://tavily.com/) and set as `TAVILY_SEARCH_API_KEY`
- **Scaleway GenAI API Key**: Provided by the FINOS team and set as `SCW_SECRET_KEY`
- (Optional) **LM Studio** for local LLM serving ([Download LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/))

## Environment Setup

Rename tje `.env.new` file in your project root to `.env` and update with the API Keys provided by the FINOS team.

## Installation

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your_username/agent-quickstart.git
cd agent-quickstart
uv sync
```

## Directory Structure

```text
Agent-QuickStart/
â”œâ”€â”€ .env
â”œâ”€â”€ llama_index_agent_example.ipynb
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input/          # Place PDF files here
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ output/         # Converted markdown files will be stored here
â””â”€â”€ database/
    â””â”€â”€ vector_store/   # ChromaDB database will be created here
```

## Setup

- **Local LLM (Optional)**:
  - Install LM Studio
  - Download a compatible model (e.g., qwen3-8b)
  - Start LM Studio server on `http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1`

## Input Data

- Place PDF documents (10K or 10Q reports) to be processed in `data/input/`
- Converted markdown files will be saved in `data/output/`

## Usage Example

We have two agent examples providing a full multi-agent execution workflow.

### SEC 10-K & 10-Q Filings Analysis with LlamaIndex

 The `llama_index_agent_example.ipynb` notebook demonstrates how to:

- Load environment variables
- Convert PDFs to markdown
- Generate vector database
- Query and evaluate RAG pipeline
- Define and run multi-agent workflow
- Leverage DeepEval across the flow execution, with a LLM-as-Judge approach

### Stock Data and Sentiment Analysis with Agno

The `agno_agent_example.ipynb` notebod demonstrates how to:

- Leverage Google Search for web search on recent information to produce sentiment analysis
- Leverage Yahoo Finance for financial data retrieval including historical stock prices and financial ratios
- Define and run multi-agent workflow to produce an analyst report

## Roadmap

### âœ… Completed

- [x] Multi-agent financial analysis workflow (Research â†’ Write â†’ Review)
- [x] RAG pipeline with financial document processing
