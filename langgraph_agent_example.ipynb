        "# LangGraph Agent Example: Reflexive Metacognitive Financial Advisor\n",
        "\n",
        "Welcome to an advanced implementation of a **Reflexive Metacognitive Financial Agent** using LangGraph and Scaleway's AI infrastructure. This architecture demonstrates how to build a self-aware financial advisor that can reason about its own capabilities, confidence levels, and limitations before providing financial guidance.\n",
        "\n",
        "This agent maintains an explicit **\"self-model\"** - a structured representation of its financial knowledge, available tools, and ethical boundaries. When faced with a financial query, it performs a metacognitive analysis to determine the safest and most appropriate response strategy.\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent asks itself critical questions like:\n",
        "- \"Do I have sufficient expertise to provide guidance on this financial topic?\"\n",
        "- \"Is this query within my designated area of financial knowledge?\"\n",
        "- \"Do I have appropriate tools to analyze this financial scenario accurately?\"\n",
        "- \"Is this a high-stakes financial decision where incorrect advice could cause significant harm?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on these assessments, it chooses between direct reasoning, specialized tool usage, or escalation to qualified financial professionals when the request exceeds its safe operating boundaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "This Financial Advisory Assistant demonstrates the critical importance of AI safety and responsibility in financial domains, where poor advice can have serious real-world consequences.\n"

        "## Definition\n",
        "A **Reflexive Metacognitive Financial Agent** is an AI system that maintains explicit awareness of its financial knowledge boundaries, confidence levels, and ethical responsibilities. It uses this self-model to select the most appropriate and safe response strategy for each financial query.\n",
        "\n",
        "## High-level Workflow\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Perceive Financial Query: The agent receives a user's financial question or request.\n",
        "2. Metacognitive Analysis: The agent analyzes the query against its self-model, assessing confidence, risk level, and regulatory considerations.\n",
        "3. Strategy Selection: Based on the analysis, the agent selects one of several strategies:\n",
        "   - Reason Directly: For general financial education within its knowledge base.\n",
        "   - Use Financial Tool: When specialized analysis tools are required and appropriate.\n",
        "   - Escalate/Refuse: For personalized advice, high-risk decisions, or regulated investment recommendations.\n",
        "4. Execute Strategy: The chosen approach is implemented with appropriate disclaimers.\n",
        "5. Respond: The agent provides educational information, tool-assisted analysis, or professional referral guidance.\n",
        "\n",
        "## When to Use / Applications\n",
        "- Financial Education Platforms: Systems that provide general financial literacy information while knowing when to refer users to professionals.\n",
        "- Robo-Advisory Preprocessing: Initial assessment layers that determine if queries require human advisor intervention.\n",
        "- Corporate Financial Assistants: Internal tools that help employees with benefits and basic financial planning while maintaining compliance.\n"
