    "# Multi-Agent Report Generation with AgentWorkflow\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore how to use an `AgentWorkflow` in LlamaIndex to create multi-agent systems. Specifically, we will create a system that can generate a report on a given topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, we leverage both local serving of a `qwen3-8b` Small Language Model (SLM) as our LLM, served by LM Studio, and a state-of-the-art model `gemini-2.5-flash` hosted by Google Cloud. For all supported LLM inference providers and models by LlamaIndex, check out the [examples documentation](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/llm/openai/) or [LlamaHub](https://llamahub.ai/?tab=llms) for a list of all supported LLMs and how to install/use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if we wanted, each agent could have a different LLM, but for this example, we will use the same LLM for all agents."

      "The history of the internet is a complex and multifaceted story that spans several decades. The modern internet as we know it today began to take shape in the 1960s, when the United States Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) funded a project to create a network of computers that could communicate with each other. This project, called ARPANET, was the first operational packet switching network, and it was launched in 1969. ARPANET was designed to be a robust and fault-tolerant network that could survive a nuclear attack, and it was initially used by government and academic researchers to communicate with each other. In the 1980s, the Internet Protocol (IP) was developed, which allowed different networks to communicate with each other and formed the basis of the modern internet. The World Wide Web (WWW) was invented in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, who developed the HTTP protocol and the first web browser. The internet quickly expanded beyond its origins in the United States and Europe, and by the 1990s, it had become a global network that connected people and organizations from all over the world. Today, the internet is an essential part of modern life, and it has revolutionized the way we communicate, access information, and conduct business.\n"

    "1. A `ResearchAgent` that will search local data as well as the web for information on the given topic.\n",

    "3. A `ReviewAgent` that will review the report and provide feedback.\n",

    "2. A `query_engine` tool to query local documents via Query Engine (RAG)\n",

The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a)  of  the  Exchange  Act.  Plaintiffs  sought  class  certification,  an  award  of  unspecified  compensatory  damages,  an  award  of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA's motion to dismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from judgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. On August 25, 2023, a majority of a three-judge Ninth Circuit panel affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court's dismissal of the case, with a third judge dissenting on the basis that the district court did not err in dismissing the case. On November 15, 2023, the Ninth Circuit denied NVIDIA's petition for rehearing en banc of the Ninth Circuit  panel's  majority  decision  to  reverse  in  part  the  dismissal  of  the  case,  which  NVIDIA  had  filed  on  October  10,  2023.  On December 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit granted NVIDIA's motion to stay the mandate pending NVIDIA's petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States and the Supreme Court's final disposition of the matter. NVIDIA filed a petition for a writ of certiorari  on  March  4,  2024.  On  June  17,  2024,  the  Supreme  Court  of  the  United  States  granted  NVIDIA's  petition  for  a  writ  of certiorari.

For the purposes of this agentic application, we use a set of metrics including G-Eval, Bias for overall system evaluation, 3 RAG metrics (Answer Relevancy, Faithfulness, and Contextual Precision) for our RAG pipeline, and the Summarization metric to assess the quality of the report writing process.These can help us measure:\n",

    "3. **Contextual Relevancy**: How relevant the retrieved context of the RAG pipeline is to the question\n",
    "4. **Bias Detection**: Whether the response contains biased content\n",
    "5. **Summarization**: Whether the response \n",
    "6. **G-Eeval**: Allows us to use a Reasoning LLM to act as a \"judge,\" scoring the final report generated by our agentic system based on our own custom-defined criteria for overall performance.\n",

The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018.

      "*   **In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation:** This putative securities class action lawsuit was initially filed in December 2018. It alleges that NVIDIA and certain executives violated the Securities Exchange Act. After being dismissed by a district court, the case was appealed. The Supreme Court reviewed the case but ultimately dismissed the writ of certiorari in December 2024. In February 2025, the case was sent back to the district court for further proceedings. The plaintiffs are seeking class certification and unspecified compensatory damages.\n",

The cases were stayed, but after a Supreme Court decision in a related case, the stay was extended for 30 days on February 5, 2025, for the parties to discuss next steps. A joint status report was due by March 7, 2025. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and the disgorgement of profits from stock sales.\n",

      "*   **Horanic v. Huang, et al.:** Filed in October 2023 in Delaware, this derivative action alleges breach of fiduciary duty and insider trading against certain officers and directors.

(Case No. 1:19-cv-01798-MN), were stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs' appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On February 5, 2025, after the Supreme Court issued its judgment dismissing the Company's petition for writ of certiorari as improvidently granted in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action, the district court extended the stay for 30 days while the parties discuss next steps and ordered the parties to file a joint status report by March 7, 2025.

The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a)  of  the  Exchange  Act.  Plaintiffs  sought  class  certification,  an  award  of  unspecified  compensatory  damages,  an  award  of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA's motion to dismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from judgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. On August 25, 2023, a majority of a three-judge Ninth Circuit panel affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court's dismissal of the case, with a third judge dissenting on the basis that the district court did not err in dismissing the case.

It alleges that between May 2017 and November 2018, NVIDIA and some of its executives made false or misleading statements about the company's channel inventory and the true impact of cryptocurrency mining on the demand for its GPUs.\n",
      "*   **Current Status:** The case has a complex history. After being dismissed by a district court, the dismissal was partially reversed on appeal. The U.S. Supreme Court took up the case but ultimately dismissed it in December 2024. As of February 2025, the case has been sent back to the district court to proceed. The plaintiffs are seeking class certification and unspecified damages.\n",

      "### **2. Derivative Lawsuits**\n",
      "\n",
      "Stemming from the same allegations as the securities class action, several derivative lawsuits have been filed on behalf of NVIDIA against certain company officers and directors. These suits claim breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and insider trading.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Delaware Lawsuits:**\n",
      "    *   ***Lipchitz v. Huang, et al.*** and ***Nelson v. Huang, et. al.*** (filed in 2019): These cases are currently stayed, with the court awaiting a status update from the parties by March 7, 2025, to decide the next steps.\n",
      "    *   ***Horanic v. Huang, et al.*** (filed in 2023): This action is also stayed, pending the final outcome of the main securities litigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **California Lawsuit:**\n",
      "    *   ***In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation*** (filed in 2019): This case was administratively closed in February 2022 and has not yet been reopened, pending the resolution of the main securities case.\n",
      "\n",
      "In all these derivative cases, the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages, the return of profits from stock sales by the executives, and reforms to NVIDIA's corporate governance.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **NVIDIA's Financial Position**\n",
      "\n",
      "As of January 26, 2025, NVIDIA has not set aside any funds (accrued a liability) for potential losses from these lawsuits. The company states that while a loss is \"reasonably possible,\" it is not considered \"probable,\" and the potential financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\n",

However, its success has been accompanied by a series of significant legal and regulatory challenges. This report details several recent litigations faced by the company, examining their nature, current status, and potential impacts on NVIDIA's business operations and reputation.\\n\\n## 1. Xockets Inc. Patent Infringement Lawsuit\\n\\n*   **Litigation Overview:** The tech startup Xockets Inc. has filed a lawsuit against NVIDIA, alleging both patent infringement and antitrust violations. Xockets claims that its proprietary Data Processing Unit (DPU) technology has been a critical element in NVIDIA's recent success. The lawsuit extends to Microsoft and RPX, accusing them of forming an illegal cartel to suppress the fair market value of Xockets' technology.\\n*   **Current Status:** The litigation is currently ongoing. Xockets is seeking an injunction to halt the sale of certain NVIDIA products, including the new Blackwell GPUs, and to stop the alleged antitrust practices.\\n*   **Potential Impact:** A ruling in favor of Xockets could have severe consequences for NVIDIA. Financially, the company could face billions in damages. Operationally, an injunction on key products would disrupt its core business and revenue streams. Furthermore, the lawsuit poses a significant reputational risk by questioning the integrity of NVIDIA's technological innovation.\\n\\n## 2. Securities Fraud Class Action Lawsuit\\n\\n*   **Litigation Overview:** NVIDIA is the defendant in a class-action lawsuit accusing the company of deliberately misleading investors. The suit alleges that NVIDIA and its CEO made false and misleading statements to downplay the company's reliance on the highly volatile cryptocurrency mining market for its GPU sales during a specific period.\\n*   **Current Status:** After NVIDIA attempted to have the case dismissed, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled to allow the lawsuit to proceed. The case is currently ongoing.\\n*   **Potential Impact:** If found liable, NVIDIA could face substantial financial penalties. The lawsuit has already damaged the company's credibility and could erode investor confidence. The ongoing legal proceedings serve as a continuous source of negative publicity and a distraction for the company's management.\\n\\n## 3. EU Antitrust Lawsuit Regarding Run:ai Acquisition\\n\\n*   **Litigation Overview:** In a proactive move, NVIDIA has filed a lawsuit against European Union antitrust regulators. The suit challenges the EU's decision to launch a formal review of NVIDIA's acquisition of the AI startup Run:ai. NVIDIA contends that the regulators are overstepping their jurisdiction by scrutinizing what it considers a minor deal, referencing a prior court ruling that limited their authority in similar cases.\\n*   **Current Status:** The case is ongoing, with NVIDIA challenging the legal grounds of the EU's regulatory review.\\n*   **Potential Impact:** This lawsuit is primarily a strategic maneuver by NVIDIA to counter what it perceives as regulatory overreach. While the direct financial impact may be limited, the outcome could set an important precedent for how future acquisitions by major tech companies are handled in the EU. It is indicative of the broader trend of intensified antitrust scrutiny facing NVIDIA globally, which could complicate its future growth and acquisition strategies.\\n\\n## Commentary on Overall Impact\\n\\nThe convergence of these legal challenges presents a significant test for NVIDIA. The patent infringement and securities fraud lawsuits pose direct and immediate threats to the company's finances and reputation. An adverse outcome in the Xockets case could disrupt NVIDIA's supply chain and product roadmap, while the securities fraud case threatens to undermine the trust between the company and its investors.\\n\\nMore broadly, the EU antitrust suit highlights a challenging new reality for NVIDIA and other tech giants: a global regulatory environment that is increasingly skeptical of their market power. This heightened scrutiny could create significant hurdles for NVIDIA's expansion plans, particularly those involving strategic acquisitions.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while NVIDIA continues to lead in innovation, its ability to successfully navigate this complex legal and regulatory landscape will be critical to sustaining its market leadership, financial stability, and long-term reputation. The outcomes of these cases will be closely monitored by all stakeholders, from investors and competitors to regulators worldwide.\"}\n",

Xockets Inc. Patent Infringement Lawsuit\\n\\n*   **Litigation Overview:** The tech startup Xockets Inc. has filed a lawsuit against NVIDIA, alleging both patent infringement and antitrust violations. Xockets claims that its proprietary Data Processing Unit (DPU) technology has been a critical element in NVIDIA's recent success. The lawsuit extends to Microsoft and RPX, accusing them of forming an illegal cartel to suppress the fair market value of Xockets' technology.\\n*   **Current Status:** The litigation is currently ongoing. Xockets is seeking an injunction to halt the sale of certain NVIDIA products, including the new Blackwell GPUs, and to stop the alleged antitrust practices.\\n*   **Potential Impact:** A ruling in favor of Xockets could have severe consequences for NVIDIA. Financially, the company could face billions in damages. Operationally, an injunction on key products would disrupt its core business and revenue streams. Furthermore, the lawsuit poses a significant reputational risk by questioning the integrity of NVIDIA's technological innovation.\\n\\n## 2. Securities Fraud Class Action Lawsuit\\n\\n*   **Litigation Overview:** NVIDIA is the defendant in a class-action lawsuit accusing the company of deliberately misleading investors. The suit alleges that NVIDIA and its CEO made false and misleading statements to downplay the company's reliance on the highly volatile cryptocurrency mining market for its GPU sales during a specific period.\\n*   **Current Status:** After NVIDIA attempted to have the case dismissed, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled to allow the lawsuit to proceed. The case is currently ongoing.\\n*   **Potential Impact:** If found liable, NVIDIA could face substantial financial penalties.

This report details several recent litigations faced by the company, examining their nature, current status, and potential impacts on NVIDIA's business operations and reputation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. Xockets Inc. Patent Infringement Lawsuit\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Litigation Overview:** The tech startup Xockets Inc. has filed a lawsuit against NVIDIA, alleging both patent infringement and antitrust violations. Xockets claims that its proprietary Data Processing Unit (DPU) technology has been a critical element in NVIDIA's recent success. The lawsuit extends to Microsoft and RPX, accusing them of forming an illegal cartel to suppress the fair market value of Xockets' technology.\n",
      "*   **Current Status:** The litigation is currently ongoing. Xockets is seeking an injunction to halt the sale of certain NVIDIA products, including the new Blackwell GPUs, and to stop the alleged antitrust practices.\n",
      "*   **Potential Impact:** A ruling in favor of Xockets could have severe consequences for NVIDIA. Financially, the company could face billions in damages. Operationally, an injunction on key products would disrupt its core business and revenue streams. Furthermore, the lawsuit poses a significant reputational risk by questioning the integrity of NVIDIA's technological innovation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. Securities Fraud Class Action Lawsuit\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Litigation Overview:** NVIDIA is the defendant in a class-action lawsuit accusing the company of deliberately misleading investors. The suit alleges that NVIDIA and its CEO made false and misleading statements to downplay the company's reliance on the highly volatile cryptocurrency mining market for its GPU sales during a specific period.\n",
      "*   **Current Status:** After NVIDIA attempted to have the case dismissed, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled to allow the lawsuit to proceed. The case is currently ongoing.\n",
      "*   **Potential Impact:** If found liable, NVIDIA could face substantial financial penalties. The lawsuit has already damaged the company's credibility and could erode investor confidence. The ongoing legal proceedings serve as a continuous source of negative publicity and a distraction for the company's management.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. EU Antitrust Lawsuit Regarding Run:ai Acquisition\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Litigation Overview:** In a proactive move, NVIDIA has filed a lawsuit against European Union antitrust regulators. The suit challenges the EU's decision to launch a formal review of NVIDIA's acquisition of the AI startup Run:ai. NVIDIA contends that the regulators are overstepping their jurisdiction by scrutinizing what it considers a minor deal, referencing a prior court ruling that limited their authority in similar cases.\n",
      "*   **Current Status:** The case is ongoing, with NVIDIA challenging the legal grounds of the EU's regulatory review.\n",
      "*   **Potential Impact:** This lawsuit is primarily a strategic maneuver by NVIDIA to counter what it perceives as regulatory overreach. While the direct financial impact may be limited, the outcome could set an important precedent for how future acquisitions by major tech companies are handled in the EU. It is indicative of the broader trend of intensified antitrust scrutiny facing NVIDIA globally, which could complicate its future growth and acquisition strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Commentary on Overall Impact\n",
      "\n",
      "The convergence of these legal challenges presents a significant test for NVIDIA. The patent infringement and securities fraud lawsuits pose direct and immediate threats to the company's finances and reputation. An adverse outcome in the Xockets case could disrupt NVIDIA's supply chain and product roadmap, while the securities fraud case threatens to undermine the trust between the company and its investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "More broadly, the EU antitrust suit highlights a challenging new reality for NVIDIA and other tech giants: a global regulatory environment that is increasingly skeptical of their market power. This heightened scrutiny could create significant hurdles for NVIDIA's expansion plans, particularly those involving strategic acquisitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, while NVIDIA continues to lead in innovation, its ability to successfully navigate this complex legal and regulatory landscape will be critical to sustaining its market leadership, financial stability, and long-term reputation. The outcomes of these cases will be closely monitored by all stakeholders, from investors and competitors to regulators worldwide.\n",
