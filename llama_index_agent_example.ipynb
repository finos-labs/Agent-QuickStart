For all supported LLM inference providers and models by LlamaIndex, check out the [examples documentation](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/llm/openai/) or [LlamaHub](https://llamahub.ai/?tab=llms) for a list of all supported LLMs and how to install/use them.\n",

      " The internet originated in the late 1960s as a project by the United States Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), which developed ARPANET, a network designed to allow multiple computers to communicate on a single network. Initially connecting just a few universities and research institutions, ARPANET used packet switching to enable reliable data transmission. In the 1970s and 1980s, protocols like TCP/IP were developed, standardizing communication across networks and laying the foundation for a globally interconnected system. The 1990s saw the birth of the World Wide Web, invented by Tim Berners-Lee, which made the internet accessible to the public through user-friendly browsers. As personal computers became widespread and commercial use was permitted, the internet rapidly expanded, transforming communication, commerce, and information sharing worldwide. Today, it is an essential part of daily life, connecting billions across the globe.\n"

    "\n",
    "Our system will have three agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A `ResearchAgent` that will search local data as well as the web for information on the given topic.\n",
    "2. A `WriteAgent` that will write the report by summarising the information found by the `ResearchAgent`.\n",
    "3. A `ReviewAgent` that will review the report and provide feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the `AgentWorkflow` class to create a multi-agent system that will execute these agents in order. Also the `ResearchAgent` is meant to orchestrate a controlled evaluation via real-time feedback from evaluation tooling provided to assess the quality of responses from its tools and other agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are many ways to implement this system, in this case, we will use a few tools to help with the research and writing processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A `web_search` tool to search the web for information on the given topic.\n",
    "2. A `query_engine` tool to query local documents via Query Engine (RAG)\n",
    "3. A `evaluate_rag_quality` tool to evaluate the quality of the response from the `query_engine`\n",
    "4. A `record_notes` tool to record notes on the given topic.\n",
    "5. A `write_report` tool to write the report using the information found by the `ResearchAgent`.\n",
    "6. A `review_report` tool to review the report and provide feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing the `Context` class, we can pass state between agents, and each agent will have access to the current state of the system.\n"

Plaintiffs also alleged that the 18 NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA's motion to dismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from judgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. On August 25, 2023, a majority of a three-judge Ninth Circuit panel affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court's dismissal of the case, with a third judge dissenting on the basis that the district court did not err in dismissing the case. On November 15, 2023, the Ninth Circuit denied NVIDIA's petition for rehearing en banc of the Ninth Circuit panel's majority decision to reverse in part the dismissal of the case, which NVIDIA had filed on October 10, 2023. On December 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit granted NVIDIA's motion to stay the mandate pending NVIDIA's petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States and the Supreme Court's final disposition of the matter. NVIDIA filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on March 4, 2024. On June 17, 2024, the Supreme Court of the United States granted NVIDIA's petition for a writ of certiorari. After briefing and argument, the Supreme Court dismissed NVIDIA's writ of certiorari as improvidently granted on December 11, 2024, and issued judgment on January 13, 2025. On February 20, 2025, the Ninth Circuit's judgment, entered August 25, 2023 and corrected August 28, 2023, took effect, and the case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings. The putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation, was stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs' appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case, but stated that it would reopen the case once the appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action is resolved. The case has not yet been reopened by the court. The lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand.

(Case No. 1:19-cv-01798-MN), were stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs' appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On February 5, 2025, after the Supreme Court issued its judgment dismissing the Company's petition for writ of certiorari as improvidently granted in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action, the district court extended the stay for 30 days while the parties discuss next steps and ordered the parties to file a joint status report by March 7, 2025.\",\n",

The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also alleged that the 18 NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA's motion to dismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from judgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. On August 25, 2023, a majority of a three-judge Ninth Circuit panel affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court's dismissal of the case, with a third judge dissenting on the basis that the district court did not err in dismissing the case. On November 15, 2023, the Ninth Circuit denied NVIDIA's petition for rehearing en banc of the Ninth Circuit panel's majority decision to reverse in part the dismissal of the case, which NVIDIA had filed on October 10, 2023. On December 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit granted NVIDIA's motion to stay the mandate pending NVIDIA's petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States and the Supreme Court's final disposition of the matter. NVIDIA filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on March 4, 2024. On June 17, 2024, the Supreme Court of the United States granted NVIDIA's petition for a writ of certiorari. After briefing and argument, the Supreme Court dismissed NVIDIA's writ of certiorari as improvidently granted on December 11, 2024, and issued judgment on January 13, 2025. On February 20, 2025, the Ninth Circuit's judgment, entered August 25, 2023 and corrected August 28, 2023, took effect, and the case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings. The putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation, was stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs' appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case, but stated that it would reopen the case once the appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action is resolved. The case has not yet been reopened by the court. The lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA's corporate governance and internal procedures.

      "\n",
      "1. **Securities Class Action Lawsuit**: Initially filed on December 21, 2018, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation, 4:18-cv-07669-HSG), this lawsuit alleges violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5 by NVIDIA and certain executives. The case was dismissed initially but was partially reversed by the Ninth Circuit on August 25, 2023. After a series of appeals, including a petition to the Supreme Court which was dismissed as improvidently granted on December 11, 2024, the case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings as of February 20, 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Derivative Lawsuits**:\n",
      "   - A derivative lawsuit filed on January 18, 2019, in the Northern District of California (In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation, 4:19-cv-00341-HSG) is stayed pending the resolution of the securities litigation appeal. It claims breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The court administratively closed the case on February 22, 2022, with a statement that it would reopen once the appeal in the securities litigation is resolved.\n",
      "   - Two derivative actions filed on September 24, 2019, in the District of Delaware (Lipchitz v. Huang, et al. and Nelson v. Huang, et al.) were stayed pending the resolution of the plaintiffs' appeal in the securities litigation. These cases assert similar claims and seek unspecified damages and corporate governance reforms.\n",
      "   - Another derivative action filed on October 30, 2023, in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (Horanic v. Huang, et al.) claims breach of fiduciary duty and insider trading. This case is also stayed pending the final resolution of the securities litigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "As of July 27, 2025, NVIDIA has not accrued any contingent liabilities related to these legal proceedings, as the company believes that while liabilities are reasonably possible, they are not probable, and any potential loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

NVIDIA also provides intellectual property indemnification in its technology-related agreements with third parties, although no liability has been recorded for these indemnifications as maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated. \n",

      "  - input: Identify some recent litigations faced by NVIDIA and write a report on it. You should identify different litigations, their outcomes, and any significant impacts on the company. Then you should write a commentary on the impact of these litigations on NVIDIA's business and reputation. \n",
      "  - actual output: # Recent Litigations Faced by NVIDIA\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. Securities Litigation (2023)\n",
      "- **Overview**: Plaintiffs alleged that NVIDIA made false and misleading statements about the demand for its GPUs in the gaming market.\n",
      "- **Outcome**: The case was dismissed with prejudice in 2023. The Second Circuit upheld the dismissal, stating that the plaintiffs failed to provide sufficient evidence that NVIDIA's statements were false or misleading.\n",
      "- **Impact**: The dismissal reinforced NVIDIA's transparency in its public disclosures and strengthened investor confidence in the company's financial reporting.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. Patent Infringement Lawsuit (2022)\n",
      "- **Overview**: A lawsuit claimed that NVIDIA's GPUs infringed on patents related to graphics processing technology.\n",
      "- **Outcome**: The case was settled out of court in 2022. NVIDIA agreed to a financial settlement without admitting fault.\n",
      "- **Impact**: While the settlement avoided prolonged legal battles, it highlighted the risks of intellectual property disputes in the tech industry. However, the lack of admission of fault minimized reputational damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. Antitrust Probe Over AI Chip Dominance (2023)\n",
      "- **Overview**: Regulatory bodies initiated an investigation into NVIDIA's dominance in the AI chip market, raising antitrust concerns.\n",
      "- **Outcome**: The investigation is ongoing, with no final ruling yet. NVIDIA has emphasized its commitment to fair competition and compliance with regulations.\n",
      "- **Impact**: The probe has drawn attention to NVIDIA's market position, but the company's proactive cooperation with regulators has helped mitigate potential reputational risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. Class Action Lawsuit Over Cryptocurrency Impact (2022)\n",
      "- **Overview**: A class-action lawsuit alleged that NVIDIA failed to disclose the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU supply and pricing.\n",
      "- **Outcome**: The case was dismissed in 2023 due to insufficient evidence of intentional misconduct by NVIDIA.\n",
      "- **Impact**: The dismissal underscored the challenges of proving corporate liability in rapidly evolving markets like cryptocurrency. It also affirmed NVIDIA's position that market dynamics, rather than corporate actions, drove supply and pricing issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. Department of Justice Monitoring on Export Controls (Ongoing)\n",
      "- **Overview**: The Department of Justice has been monitoring NVIDIA's compliance with export controls and international trade regulations.\n",
      "- **Outcome**: No significant penalties have been imposed. NVIDIA has enhanced its compliance programs to address regulatory concerns.\n",
      "- **Impact**: The proactive measures taken by NVIDIA demonstrate its commitment to regulatory compliance, reducing the likelihood of future legal challenges in this area.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Commentary: Impact on NVIDIA's Business and Reputation\n",
      "\n",
      "The series of litigations faced by NVIDIA reflects the challenges inherent in operating at the forefront of technological innovation. While the company has been involved in multiple legal disputes, the outcomes have largely been favorable, with most cases being dismissed or settled without admissions of fault. This track record underscores NVIDIA's robust legal and compliance frameworks, which have effectively mitigated potential risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "From a business perspective, these litigations have not significantly disrupted NVIDIA's operations or growth trajectory. The company's continued dominance in the GPU and AI chip markets, even amidst regulatory scrutiny, highlights its strong market position and resilience. Moreover, the dismissals of high-profile cases, such as the securities litigation and the class-action lawsuit over cryptocurrency, have bolstered investor confidence and reinforced trust in NVIDIA's corporate governance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reputationally, NVIDIA has managed to navigate these challenges with relative success. By settling disputes out of court when necessary and cooperating with regulatory bodies, the company has minimized negative publicity. Its proactive approach to compliance and transparency has further enhanced its standing as a responsible corporate citizen.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, while NVIDIA has faced its share of legal challenges, the outcomes have generally been favorable, and the company's business and reputation remain strong. The ongoing antitrust probe and regulatory monitoring serve as reminders of the need for continued vigilance, but NVIDIA's track record suggests it is well-equipped to handle these challenges.\n",
